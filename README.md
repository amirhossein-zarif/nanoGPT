# nanoGPT

This project contains slight modifications to the code from [Karpathy's GitHub page](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt/tree/master). I extracted a small subset of the main dataset to train nanoGPT within the limitations of Google Colab. The training was performed on approximately 100K tokens, and sample results are available every 250 steps.
