# nanoGPT
I made slight modifications to the code from Karpathy's GitHub page (https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt/tree/master). I also extracted a small subset of the main dataset to train nanoGPT within the limitations of Google Colab. The training was performed on approximately 100 K tokens.
